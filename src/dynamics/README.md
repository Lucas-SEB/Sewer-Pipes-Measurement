# Dynamics Stabilisation Model

## Matlab and Simulink

There are 2 Matlab scripts `.m` to initialize the parameters values before running the Simulink files `.slx` for the simulations. 

## Contents
- `simple-init.m` and `simple-lqr-control.slx` are prepared to directly run the current simulation.
- `init.m` and `lqr-control.slx` have integrated more configurations and this is where all the tests have been carried out.
- `\old-files` contains different methods or obsolete tests that do not match the current configuration.

## Steps followed in this Simulations

* Open and run Matlab file `.m`.
* Open the respective simulink file `.slx`.
* Play
